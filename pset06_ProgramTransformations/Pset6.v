Modern compilers achieve excellent performance by leveraging a wide variety of
program transformations.  For example, GCC (the GNU C compiler) version 10.2
produces the *exact same* assembly code for the following two programs (if you
want to see for yourself, try it on https://godbolt.org!):

1. Recursive version with accumulator, naive division and modulo, no function
   inlining, multiple returns, redundant ``+ 1``, not tail-recursive::

      static unsigned int affine(unsigned int n,
                                 unsigned int slope,
                                 unsigned int offset) {
          return n * slope + offset;
      }

      unsigned int collatz1(unsigned int start) {
          if (start == 1)
            return 0;
          else if (start % 2 == 0)
            return collatz1(start / 2) + 1;
          else
            return collatz1(affine(start, 3, 1)) + 1;
      }

2. Single loop, inlined function, bitwise arithmetic::

      unsigned int collatz2(unsigned int start) {
          unsigned int flight = 0;
          while (start != 1) {
              flight++;
              if ((start & 1) == 0) {
                  start = start >> 1;
              } else {
                  start = start * 2 + start + 1;
              }
          }
          return flight;
      }

The way GCC achieves this is by applying a sequence of transformation passes on
the code: you can see the output of each intermediate pass (all ~320 of them)
using ``gcc -O3 -fdump-tree-all -fdump-rtl-all -c collatz1.c``.  For instance,
the ``ssa`` pass puts the code into a form similar to the three-address code
that we saw in class, the ``tailr1`` passes convert the recursive function to a
loop, etc.

Students interested in an introduction to the magic of modern compiler
optimizations might enjoy Matt Godbolt's 2017 talk at CPPCon, *What Has My
Compiler Done for Me Lately? Unbolting the Compiler's Lid*
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSkpMdDe4g4).

In this lab, we'll see how formal methods can help us reason about the
correctness of these optimization passes, focusing on a few commonly used
optimizations.

*A few notes of caution*:

- Many of the proofs in this lab can be a bit long to complete fully manually:
  we encourage you to try your hand at simple automation.  However, make sure
  that your whole file compiles in a reasonable amount of time (at most a minute
  or two).

- When decomposed into the right sequence of lemmas, most of the theorems in
  this pset have relatively short proofs.  The best way to find these lemmas is
  to approach each problem cautiously, trying to work an understanding of the
  proof before diving into long series of `invert`, `econstructor`, etc.  In
  general, it's also a good idea to admit lemmas until you are sure that they
  allow you to prove the complete theorem, then go back and prove the lemmas —
  but do take the time to convince yourself that your lemmas make sense, so that
  you don't waste time using incorrect lemmas.

- We have included plenty of hints below in the HINTS section of the 
  signature file.

Language definition
===================

We'll start with a variant of FRAP's usual imperative language, with a few
twists: first, we'll generalize the `Plus` constructor, allowing a number of
binary operators.  Second, we'll add function calls (for simplicity, all
functions take two arguments, and they assign their results to variables).
|*)

Inductive BinopName :=
| LogAnd
| Eq
| ShiftLeft
| ShiftRight
| Times
| Divide
| Plus
| Minus
| Modulo.

Inductive expr: Set :=
| Const (n: nat)
| Var (x: var)
| Binop (b: BinopName) (e1 e2: expr).

Inductive cmd :=
| Skip
| Assign (x: var) (e: expr)
| AssignCall (x: var) (f: string) (e1 e2: expr)
| Sequence (c1 c2: cmd)
| If (e: expr) (thn els: cmd)
| While (e: expr) (body: cmd).

(*|
Defining a few notations will make things more readable (you don't need to
understand how these notations work):
|*)

Declare Scope expr.
Delimit Scope expr with expr.

Coercion Const : nat >-> expr.
Coercion Var : var >-> expr.

    (at level 75, e at level 0).
Notation "'while' e 'loop' body 'done'" :=
  (While e%expr body)
    (at level 75).

Here are a few example programs:
|*)

Example Times3Plus1Body :=
  ("n" <- "n" * 3 + 1).

Example FactBody :=
  ("f" <- 1;;
   while "n" loop
         "f" <- "f" * "n";;
   "n" <- "n" - 1
                 done).

Example FactRecBody :=
  (when "n" == 1 then
     "f" <- 1
   else
     "f" <- call1 "fact_r" ("n" - 1);;
     "f" <- "f" * "n"
                   done).

Example FactTailRecBody :=
  (when "n" == 1 then
     "f" <- "acc"
   else
     "f" <- call2 "fact_tr" ("n" - 1) ("acc" * "n")
                 done).

Example CollatzBody :=
  (when ("start" == 1) then
     Skip
   else when ("start" mod 2 == 0) then
     "start" <- "start" / 2
   else
     (* `call1 f arg` is short for `call2 f arg 0` *)
     "start" <- call1 "times3plus1" ("start" + 0)
                     done;;
     "flight" <- call2 "collatz" "start" ("flight" + 1)
                      done).

The coercions defined in the previous section make programs easier to write by
allowing to write `x` for `Var x` and `n` for `Const n`, but they can be
confusing when reading programs or proving properties, so the following line
turns them off:
|*)

Set Printing Coercions.

Semantics
=========

Our first step is to give a meaning to these new constructs.  Let's start with
an interpreter for binary operators:
|*)

Fixpoint interp_binop (b: BinopName) (n1 n2: nat) {struct b} :=
  match b with
  | LogAnd => Nat.land n1 n2
  | Eq => if (n1 ==n n2) then 1 else 0
  | Plus => n1 + n2
  | Minus => n1 - n2
  | Times => n1 * n2
  | Divide => n1 / n2
  | ShiftLeft => Nat.shiftl n1 n2
  | ShiftRight => Nat.shiftr n1 n2
  | Modulo => Nat.modulo n1 n2
  end.

(*|
For expressions, we'll use an interpreter to implement the following rules::

              n1 = n2
           ------------
            ⟦n2⟧ᵥ = n1

    (x ↦ a) ∈ v         x ∉ v
   --------------     ----------
      ⟦x⟧ᵥ = a         ⟦x⟧ᵥ = 0

            ⟦e1⟧ᵥ = a1
            ⟦e2⟧ᵥ = a2
      a = interp_binop b a1 a2
   -----------------------------
       ⟦Binop b e1 e2⟧ᵥ = a

..
|*)

Definition valuation := fmap var nat.

Fixpoint interp_arith (e: expr) (v: valuation) {struct e}: nat :=
  match e with
  | Const n => n
  | Var x => match v $? x with Some a => a | None => 0 end
  | Binop b e1 e2 => interp_binop b (interp_arith e1 v) (interp_arith e2 v)
  end.

(*|
For commands, we'll use an inductive `Prop` to define big-step semantics.
This is an opportunity to show that compiler proofs can work with a variety
of semantics styles, since we focused on small-step semantics in lecture.
The rules for `Assign`, `While`, `If`, and `Skip` are the same as usual; for
example::

                 ⟦e⟧ᵥ = a
   ----------------------------------- EvalAssign
    (v, Assign x e) ↓ᵩ (v $+ (x, a))

    (c1, v) ↓ᵩ v'   (c2, v') ↓ᵩ v''
   ----------------------------------- EvalSequence
       (v, Sequence c1 c2) ↓ᵩ v''

Notice the subscript φ: this indicates that we have an environment of functions.
This environment of functions gives the body of each function, the names of its
arguments, and the name of its return value.  For example, to say that the
function "collatz" has body `CollatzBody`, takes arguments "start" and "flight",
and writes its result to "out", we would write::

   phi = $0 $+ ("collatz", (("start", "flight"), "out", CollatzBody))

and to say that function "factorial" has body `FactBody`, takes argument "n",
and writes its result to "f", we might write the following (every function takes
two parameters, so we use "" as the name of the second argument of "factorial").

   phi = $0 $+ ("factorial", (("n", ""), "f", FactBody))

We need an additional rule `EvalAssignCall` for function calls::

            (f ↦ ((x1, x2), y, body)) ∈ φ
               ⟦e1⟧ᵥ = a1    ⟦e2⟧ᵥ = a2
       (body, ($0 $+ (x1, a1) $+ (x2, a2))) ↓ᵩ v'
                     (y ↦ a) ∈ v'
    ------------------------------------------------
      (AssignCall x f e1 e2, v) ↓ᵩ (v $+ (x, a))

A few notes:

- This rule passes arguments by value: that is, the function's arguments are
  evaluated in the current valuation ``v``: ``⟦e⟧ᵥ = a``.

- The function environment ``phi`` (represented as φ above) maps function names
  (strings) to function signatures and function bodies:
  ``(f ↦ ((x1, x2), y, body)) ∈ φ``.

- Functions return their output in variables indicated by their signatures:
  ``(y ↦ a) ∈ v1``.

- Functions do not have access to the contexts of their callers: ``body`` runs
  in a clean environment.

Here is how it looks in Coq:
|*)

Definition environment := fmap string ((var * var) * var * cmd).

Now let's check that our semantics compute the right values.  The `eval_intro`
tactic below may be useful for the following proofs.  You do not need to
understand its implementation; what matters is that it attempts to construct a
proof of `eval`, and it chooses between `EvalWhileTrue` and `EvalWhileFalse` and
between `EvalIfTrue` and `EvalIfFalse` by attempting to satisfy all the premises
of each of them.  It stops if it cannot conclusively decide which case applies.
|*)

(*|
To call functions, we need to specify their signatures:
|*)

Notation TimesThreePlus1_signature := (("n", ""), "n", Times3Plus1Body).
Notation Fact_signature := (("n", ""), "f", FactBody).
Notation FactRec_signature := (("n", ""), "f", FactRecBody).
Notation FactTailRec_signature := (("n", "acc"), "f", FactTailRecBody).
Notation Collatz_signature := (("start", "flight"), "flight", CollatzBody).

And to make goals more readable, we'll define a shorthand
`eval_returns phi v cmd outVar result`, which means “running `cmd` in
environment `phi` with valuation `v` returns `result` in `outVar`”:

Arithmetic optimizations
========================

Let's teach our compiler a few arithmetic optimizations.  All these
optimizations will be local, so we'll define them in terms of `interp_binop`:
every optimization will take a binary operator and two optimized expressions,
and it will return an optimized expression, without recursing.

Below, we will discuss four different flavors of arithmetic optimizations.  You
do not have to implement and prove all of them; instead, you just need to
implement the first one (constant folding) and one of the next three; you are
free to pick which one.

Here are the optimizations:

1. Folding constant subexpressions using properties of `+`, `*`, `/`
2. Precomputing constant subexpressions
3. Rewriting `*`, `/`, `mod` of powers of 2
4. Rewriting `*` as a sum of shifts

Options 4 is quite a bit more challenging than the others… but also quite
interesting!

To make sure that our optimizations are reasonable, we'll introduce a very
simple cost model; it gives us an estimate of the time it takes to run an
operation:
|*)

Fixpoint arith_cost (e: expr) : nat :=
  match e with
  | Binop b e1 e2 =>
    match b with
    | LogAnd | Eq | ShiftLeft | ShiftRight | Plus | Minus => 1
    | Times => 8
    | Divide | Modulo => 16
    end + arith_cost e1 + arith_cost e2
  | _ => 0
  end.

(*|
Constant folding
----------------

We'll start by applying the following rules:

- `n + 0 → n`
- `n * 0 → 0`
- `n / 1 → n`

This set is not complete in any sense; in addition to these three rewrites, we
encourage you to add extras and see how robust your proofs are to the changes.
Note that your optimization function should *not* be recursive!  We will
implement repeated rule application later on top of your function.

Precomputation

This is the first of three options.  If you implement this optimization, you do
not have to implement the next two.

We'll teach the compiler to simplify constant expressions: if an operator has
two constants as arguments, we'll precompute the value.

Note that your optimization function should *not* be recursive!  We will
implement repeated rule application later on top of your function.

Optimizing power-of-2 operations
--------------------------------

This is the second of three options.  If you implement this optimization, you do
not have to implement the other two.

Operations like multiplication, division, and modulo are typically relatively
slow, so we'd like to implement them more efficiently.  We'll use the following
trick:

- `n / 2^k` → `n >> k`
- `n * 2^k` → `n << k`
- `n mod 2^k` → `n & (2^k - 1)`

Here is a function that returns `Some k` if its input is equal to `2^k` and
`None` otherwise:

Rewriting multiplications
-------------------------

This is the last of three options.  If you implement this optimization, you do
not have to implement the previous two.

All numbers can be written as sums of powers of two, so we can replace all
mutiplications by sums of bitshifts:

- `n * ∑_k 2^k` → `∑_k n << k`

Here is a function that computes a number's decomposition by returning the
offsets of its nonzero bits:

That's it for expression optimizations!  Now, let's see command optimizations.

Command optimizations
=====================

In this part, we'll consider three optimizations.  You do not have to implement
all three; instead, you need to implement the first one and either one of the
last two:

- Simple dead-code elimination, by removing `Skip` nodes
- Constant propagation
- Loop unrolling

Loop unrolling is trickier than constant propagation.  And if you want a
challenge, constant propagation includes an *optional* generalization that makes
it *a lot* harder.

Oh, and if you're not excited about either of these optimizations, feel free to
pick a different one!  Just make sure that you run it by us so we can confirm
that it's reasonably difficult.  Want some ideas?  Check out
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Tree-SSA-passes.html.

Skip removal
------------

Our first optimization will be a very simple form of dead-code elimination, in
which we remove instances of `Skip`.  The following helper function might be useful: you can use it to check if a given command is a `Skip`: `if is_skip c then … else …` (of course, using a regular `match` works as well!).
|*)

Definition is_skip (c: cmd) : sumbool (c = Skip) (c <> Skip) :=
  ltac:(cases c; econstructor; equality).

Fixpoint opt_unskip (c: cmd) : cmd :=
  match c with
  | Skip => Skip
  | Assign v e => Assign v e
  | AssignCall x f e1 e2 => AssignCall x f e1 e2
  | Sequence c1 c2 => match (opt_unskip c1, opt_unskip c2) with
                     | (Skip, Skip) => Skip
                     | (c1', Skip) => c1'
                     | (Skip, c2') => c2'
                     | (c1', c2') => Sequence c1' c2'
                     end
  | If e1 c1 c2 => If e1 (opt_unskip c1) (opt_unskip c2)
  | While e c1 => While e (opt_unskip c1)
  end.

Constant propagation
--------------------

This is the first of two options.  If you implement this optimization, you do
not have to implement the next one.

At the beginning of this pset we looked at constant folding, which uses
properties of arithmetic operations to simplify expressions.  Here, we'll look
at something slightly different: constant propagation.

Constant propagation is a form of static evaluation: it analyzes assignments to
detect cases in which the value being assigned is a constant; when it is, it
propagates it through the rest of the program.  This means that in a program
like `Assign x (Const n);; …`, we'll want to replace all instances of `x` with
`Const n` in `…`.  We'll keep a map `consts` tracking variables that have
constant values and use it to rewrite the program.

The first step is to define constant propagation for arithmetic expressions.
Since there are no assignments in expressions, this is just a matter of
substituting known values recursively:
|*)

Fixpoint opt_arith_constprop (c: expr) (consts: valuation) {struct c} : expr :=
  match c with
  | Const n => Const n
  | Var x => match consts $? x with
            | Some k => Const k
            | None => Var x
            end
  | Binop b e1 e2 => Binop b (opt_arith_constprop e1 consts) (opt_arith_constprop e2 consts)
  end.

(*|
What is the correctness criterion for constant propagation?  The environment of
statically known values, `consts`, needs to be consistent with the dynamic
valuation.  This is what `consts $<= v` means; `$<=` is a notation for the
`includes` function, for which the FRAP library provides many useful lemmas.
You can find these lemmas using `Search`; for example, use `Search "$<=" "$?"`
to find all theorems that mention the operators `$<=` and `$?`.
|*)

    consts $<= v ->

Qed.

(*|
We can now define constant propagation on commands.  Propagating constants
through a program returns a new program, as well as a new set of known
constants.  Think carefully about the following cases:

- Assignments and function calls: these should update the `consts` map.  If the
  value being assigned is a constant, then it should be added to the map;
  otherwise, it should be removed from the map, using the `$-` operator.

- Conditionals: in a fully general implementation, we would want to reconcile
  the information learned along both branches of the `If`.  In this simple
  version, we will not do that: we'll simply reset the `consts` map to `$0`
  after constant-propagating through both branches.

- Loops: Constant-propagating through loops requires tracking the set of
  variables written in the loop.  Instead, we will reset the `consts` map when
  entering the body of a loop and reset it as well after exiting the loop.

In addition to propagating constants, you may be tempted to remove the
corresponding `Assign` node from the AST (replacing it with a `Skip`, for
example).  But in fact, the assignment *should be kept*: it's not safe to remove
the assignment entirely — can you see why?

Loop unrolling
--------------

This is the second of two options.  If you implement this optimization, you do
not have to implement the previous one.

Reasoning across loop iterations is trickier than reasoning about loop-free
code, so one common optimization in compilers is *loop unrolling*, a process
whereby a loop body is repeated multiple times.  For example, consider the
following snippet::

    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
       out[i] = in[i];
    }

an optimizing compiler might replace it with the following::

    for (i = 0; i + 4 <= len; i += 4) { // Unrolled loop
       out[i] = in[i];
       out[i + 1] = in[i + 1];
       out[i + 2] = in[i + 2];
       out[i + 3] = in[i + 3];
    }
    for (; i < len; i++) { // Fix-up
       out[i] = in[i];
    }

In this example, unrolling would enable the compiler to optimize the
assignments, for example by coalescing them into larger memory operations
(“vectorizing”)::

    for (i = 0; i + 4 <= len; i += 4) { // Unrolled loop
       out[i:i+4] = in[i:i+4];
    }
    for (; i < len; i++) { // Fix-up
       out[i] = in[i];
    }

Let's implement a simple form of this optimization.  Since we have `while` loops
instead of `for` loops we'll recognize a slightly different pattern::

   while (counter) loop
     …body…;;
     counter <- counter - 1
   done

And for simplicity, we'll unroll each loop twice, so we'll generate the
following code::

   when (counter mod 2) then
     …body…;;
     counter <- counter - 1
   done
   while (counter) loop
     …body…;;
     counter <- counter - 1
     …body…;;
     counter <- counter - 1
   done

First, let's write a function to make sure that a given program (`body`) does
not write to a variable.  We'll need this to make sure that the loop body
doesn't overwrite the loop variable.
|*)

(* HINT 3-4 (see Pset6Sig.v) *)
Fixpoint read_only (c: cmd) (x0: var) {struct c} : bool.
Admitted.

(*|
With this, we can define the loop-unrolling transformation, in three steps:

First, a function that checks whether a program looks exactly like the
unrollable template above; if it does, this function returns the loop variable
and the body of the loop; otherwise it returns `None`; it does not recurse:
|*)

Definition opt_unroll_match_loop (c: cmd) : option (var * cmd).
Admitted.
Arguments opt_unroll_match_loop : simpl never. (* Coq magic *)

(*|
We recommend that you define a lemma that tells you what must be true about `c`
if `opt_unroll_match_loop c = Some (x, body)` holds.
|*)


(*|
Second, we need a function to generate the unrolled pattern; you can use any
implementation you want for the fix-up phase as long as you're indeed
implementing unrolling (the fix-up phase is the phase that adjusts for the fact
that the loop variable may not be a multiple of 2 at the start of the loop).
This is just a transcription of the C code shown earlier: it takes a loop body
and the variable it iterates on, and it returns a program similar to the
unrolled loop shown above.
|*)

Definition opt_unroll_template_de (x: var) (body: cmd) : cmd.
Admitted.

(*|
Third, we can write the full optimization, which runs `opt_unroll_match_loop` at
all places in the AST and uses `opt_unroll_template_de` when it finds a relevant
place.  For simplicity, you do not have to unroll loops recursively within the
body of an unrolled loop.
|*)

Fixpoint opt_unroll (c: cmd) : cmd.

  opt_unroll CollatzBody = CollatzBody.
Proof.
Admitted.

Proof.
Admitted.

(*|
For the proof of correctness, you'll want to prove a number of side lemmas (our
solution has 5!).  To help you get started, here are a few facts on modulo (you
can refer to them using `Mod2.…`, e.g. `Mod2.small`:
|*)

End Mod2.

(*|
Good luck with the correctness proof!  Remember to check the hints in the signature file or come to office hours if you run into issues.  To get you started, here is a lemma that lets you use `read_only _ _ _` hypotheses:
|*)

Lemma eval_read_only: forall {phi v v' x c},
    eval phi v c v' ->
    read_only c x = true ->
    v' $? x = v $? x.

    eval phi v c v' ->
    eval phi v (opt_unroll c) v'.

Going further
=============

The following are suggestions, if you are interested in exploring further.
Beware that proving correctness for the optimizations below can be quite
time-consuming!

Tail-call elimination
---------------------

Tail-call elimination transforms recursive functions into loops, which saves
stack space and time pushing and popping items on the stack.  You can read more
about tail-call elimination at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call .

The first step is to check that all calls to a given function are tail calls:
|*)

Axiom may_tco: forall (is_tail: bool) (f: string) (c: cmd), bool.

(*|
Then, we can perform tail-call elimination, under the assumption that calls to
`f` are in fact tail calls:
|*)

Axiom opt_tco : forall (f: string) (x1 x2: var) (c: cmd), cmd.

(*|
The correctness lemma looks roughly like this:
|*)

Axiom opt_tco_sound : forall phi c f x1 x2,
    may_tco true f c = true ->
    forall v v',
      eval phi v c v' ->
      eval phi v (opt_tco f x1 x2 c) (v' $+ ("continue", 0)).

(*|
Function Inlining
-----------------

Inlining reveals optimization opportunities by allowing the compiler to
specialize a function's body to a given call site.

When inlining, the compiler needs to be particularly careful not to overwrite
the caller's variables, nor not to give the inlined function body access to the
caller's variables.
|*)

Axiom opt_inline : forall (phi: environment) (c: cmd), cmd.

(*|
Note that inlining a function will add the (renamed) locals of the function to
the current valuation, so the correctness theorem has to be a bit different:
|*)

Axiom opt_inline_sound : forall phi c v v',
    eval phi v c v' ->
    exists v'',
      eval phi v (opt_inline phi c) v'' /\
      (v' $<= v'').
End Impl.

Module ImplCorrect : Pset6Sig.S := Impl.
